# Data-professional-survey-project-using-PowerBI

I created these visualizations using PowerBI. It presents a summary of a survey from data professionals.

1, Country of Survey Takers: This bar chart shows the distribution of survey participants by country. The United States has the highest number of participants, followed by India, then Canada, with the UK and other countries having fewer participants.

2, Favorite Programming Language: The horizontal bar chart lists programming languages along with the count of votes for each as the favorite. Python appears to be the most popular, followed by R, with other languages like C/C++, JavaScript, and Java trailing behind.

3, Average Salary by Job Title: This multi-colored horizontal bar chart displays the average salary for different job titles among data professionals. Data Scientists seem to have the highest average salary, followed by Data Engineers, Data Architects, and others. Data Analysts and Database Developers have lower average salaries in comparison.

4, Count of Survey Takers & Average Age of Survey Taker: This section includes two big numbers indicating the total number of survey participants (630) and their average age (29.87 years).

5, Happiness With Work/Life Balance: This half donut chart measures the happiness level of participants with their work-life balance on a scale from 0 to 10. The chart shows a score of 5.74 out of 10, suggesting a moderate level of happiness with work-life balance among the respondents.

6, Happiness with Salary: Another half donut chart similar to the Work/Life Balance one, showing the happiness score related to salary. The score here is 4.27 out of 10, indicating a lower level of satisfaction with salary as compared to work-life balance.

7, Difficulty to beark into data. The pie chart shows a range of perceptions about the difficulty of entering the data field, with the majority considering it neither easy nor difficult, and significant numbers finding it either easy or difficult to some degree.
